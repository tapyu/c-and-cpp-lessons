# Makefile

A Makefile is a text file used primarily in Unix and Unix-like operating systems to automate the build process of software projects. It contains a set of rules and dependencies that specify how the project's source code files should be compiled and linked to create executables, libraries, or other output files. Makefiles are written in a simple scripting language and are processed by the make utility.
