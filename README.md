## What is casting?

"Casting" is a feature in programming languages like `C` and `C++`, and it refers to the act of explicitly converting a value from one data type to another. It's a way to instruct the compiler to interpret or treat a value as if it belongs to a different data type for a specific operation.

Type of casting:
- `C-Style Casting`: This is the traditional way of casting, and it is inherited from the `C` programming language. It uses parentheses with the target data type in front of the value to be cast.
