# Shared and static libraries

Now, let's compile and use these files to create both a static and shared library.

1. Create a static library:
```cpp
gc -c mylib_static.cpp -o mylib_static.o
```
1. Linking: The object files are then linked together to create the final executable. During the linking process, the linker resolves the symbol reference to `addNumbers` in `main.o` with the actual implementation in `mylib.o`. The linker also includes any necessary system libraries or other dependencies.
1. The linking process can be performed using a `C++` compiler or a dedicated linker, such as `ld` on Unix-like systems. When you compile and link your code using the `gcc` command, it internally invokes the `ld` linker to perform the final linking step. The output of the linking process is typically an executable file (e.g., `program`). This executable can then be executed to run the program and produce the desired output.
1. The linking process occurs when you compile and build the final executable. The linking happens behind the scenes and is performed by the `C++` compiler or the dedicated linker. When you compile the program by invoking the C++ compiler, such as g++, with the source files, the compiler handles both the compilation and linking stages. In this case, the linking process is transparent to you as the programmer.
1. When you execute the command `gcc main.cpp mylib.cpp -o program -lstdc++`, **the gcc compiles `main.cpp` into `main.o`, `mylib.cpp` into `mylib.o`, and then links `main.o`, `mylib.o`, and the standard C++ library (`-lstdc++`) to produce the `program` executable**. The `-lstdc++` flag tells the compiler to link the standard `C++` library. This should resolve the undefined reference errors related to the standard `C++` symbols, such as when the linker (ld) cannot find the references to `std::cout`, `std::endl`, or other related symbols (try to omit this to see the error arising).
1. The `-o` option in the `gcc` command is used to specify the name of the output file or the executable that will be generated after the compilation and linking process. The default name for the output file generated by the `gcc` compiler, if the `-o` option is not used, is `a.out`.
1. The resulting executable file, `program`, is the linked and fully executable program.  If the executable is located in the current directory, you can run it using `./program`.
