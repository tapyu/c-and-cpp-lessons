# Makefile

#### **What is the Makefile** 
[A][3] Makefile is one of the earliest build automation tool of software projects, used primarily in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is a text file which contains a set of rules and dependencies that specify how the project's source code files should be compiled and linked to create executables, libraries, or other output files. Makefiles are written in a simple scripting language and are processed by the `make` utility.

Makefiles are essential tools in `C`/`C++` projects for automating the build process. They provide a structured and efficient way to compile, link, and manage source code files, libraries, and dependencies. Here's a brief overview of their usage in `C`/`C++` projects:
