## DejaGNU

DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. It provides a standardized interface for testing command-line programs, libraries, and other software components. DejaGnu is often associated with the GNU Project and is used extensively in the testing of GNU software. DejaGnu is primarily used for testing programs and software components written in the C and C++ programming languages. It was developed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and is closely associated with the GNU Project. As a result, many GNU software packages, which are often written in C and C++, use DejaGnu for their testing needs.

Key features of DejaGnu include:

- `Scripting Language`: DejaGnu uses the Expect scripting language to automate the testing process. Expect is a scripting language designed for automating interactions with interactive command-line programs.
- `Standardized Interface`: DejaGnu provides a standardized interface for creating and running tests. It allows developers to write test scripts that check the behavior of their software in a systematic way.
- `Reusability`: Test scripts written with DejaGnu can be reused across different platforms and architectures. This makes it easier to maintain a consistent testing process across various environments.
- `Test Results Reporting`: DejaGnu can generate detailed reports of test results, making it easier for developers to identify issues and track the progress of testing efforts.
- `Test Suites`: DejaGnu supports the creation of test suites, which are collections of related tests. This is useful for organizing tests based on different aspects of the software's functionality.
