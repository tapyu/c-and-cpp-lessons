#### When should I use the `extern` keyword?

The extern keyword in `C` and `C++` is used to declare a global variable or function that is used in multiple source files and thus must be linked toghether. The `extern` keyword basically says that a function/variable that is referenced in a source file `file1.c` is [defined][1] somewhere else, say, in a source file `file2.c`.

Here, It is important to understand the difference between defining a variable and declaring a variable:

- A variable is declared when the compiler is informed that a variable exists (and this is its type); it does not allocate the storage for the variable at that point. You may declare a variable multiple times (though once is sufficient).
- A variable is defined when the compiler allocates the storage for the variable. You may only define it once within a given scope. A variable definition is also a declaration, but not all variable declarations are definitions.

#### How to define a global variable?

The clean, reliable way to declare and define global variables is to use a header file to contain an `extern` declaration of the variable. The header is included by the one source file that defines the variable and by all the source files that reference the variable.

For each program, one (and only one) source file defines the variable. Similarly, one header file should declare the variable. The header file is crucial; it enables cross-checking between independent TUs (the `.i` file generating after the preprocessing step. Each source file typically corresponds to a single translation unit) and ensures consistency.

The extern keyword is not required in the header file because it's common practice for header files to contain declarations, and declarations are implicitly treated as `extern`. I use the keyword `extern` in front of function declarations in headers for consistency â€” to match the `extern` in front of variable declarations in headers. Many people prefer not to use `extern` in front of function declarations; the compiler doesn't care
